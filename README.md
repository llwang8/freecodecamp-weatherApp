## FreeCodeCamp: Build a Local Weather Viewer

I built a Local Weather Viewer with JavaScript, jQuery, HTML and CSS, and Open Weather API, while following some best practices for structuring HTML, writing efficient CSS, and commenting code along the way.

 User can see the weather in a set location, see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather and push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

#Built with:

Implemented with JavaScript, jQuery, HTML and CSS. Also used Open Weather API, digital color meter.
